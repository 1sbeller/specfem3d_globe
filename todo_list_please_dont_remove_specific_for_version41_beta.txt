Dimitri Komatitsch, August 29, 2009:

non-exhaustive list of things to do in version 4.1_beta (in addition
to the general todo list for SPECFEM3D_GLOBE version 4.0 or above,
which is in file ../todo_list_please_dont_remove.txt ):

- put the full write_seismograms.f90 routine back, with full support for ASCII
and binary SAC (with Bernhard Schuberth); for the Gordon Bell runs I had
removed the SAC binary routines because they had to be linked with C

- put the sensitivity kernels and adjoint runs back
