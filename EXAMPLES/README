This folder contains several examples of how to run forward and adjoint simulations.
Each example is explained in more detail in a readme file contained in the example folders.


The following examples are provided:

- basic usage:

  * regional_Greece_small/

  contains an example for a small regional simulation and an event located in southern Greece;
  the example can be run as a small test on a single desktop machine
  (4 CPUs, forward simulation lasts ~15min, kernel simulation lasts ~40min) 

  * regional_MiddleEast/

  contains an example for a regional simulation for the Middle East region
  (64 CPUs, forward simulation lasts ~15min, kernel simulation lasts ~40min)

  * global_s362ani/

  contains an example for a global simulation using S362ANI as 3-D background model
  (150 CPUs, forward simulation lasts ~1h 55min, kernel simulation lasts ~4h 35min)

  * global_PREM_kernels/

  contains examples for amplitude and traveltime kernels using PREM as background model;
  both examples focus on how adjoint sources for filtered measurements would be constructed and used.
  (384 CPUs, forward simulations last ~1h 12min, kernel simulations last ~2h 13min)


- PREM benchmark solutions:

  * benchmarks/ 

  contains PREM benchmarks for comparing SEM outputs with normal-mode solutions 
  (various resolutions: Vanuatu 384 CPUs/ Bolivia 1536 CPUs) 


- seismic interferometry:

  * noise_examples/

  contains examples of how to compute noise sensitivity kernels for global and regional simulations
  (various resolutions: global 600 CPUs/ regional 400 CPUs)
