Examples of cross-correlation traveltime and amplitude kernel
simulations for a sample source-receiver pair under the directories
'traveltime' and 'amplitude', respectively.


Both examples make use of filtered adjoint sources. The basic steps involve:

1. run a forward simulation:

   use the scripts ./process.sh to run a single forward simulation and create synthetic
   seismograms in the OUTPUT_FILES/ directory.


   You can compare the solutions obtained with the reference seismograms provided in
   directory REF_SEIS/.


2. create adjoint sources:

   use the scripts SEM/create_adjoint_sources.sh to create filtered adjoint sources.

   Filtering adjoint sources involves filtering twice, first the synthetics before
   constructing the adjoint sources, then a second time filtering the adjoint sources
   again. this leads to correctly computed adjoint sensitivity kernels for a band-passed
   traveltime or amplitude measurement within a specified time window. 

3. run a kernel simulation:

   use the scripts ./process.kernel.sh to run a kernel simulation and create the corresponding
   sensitivity kernels in the DATABASES_MPI/ directory.

   Visualizations of kernels with Paraview involve creating VTK-files, using the script ./xcombine_vol_data.sh.
